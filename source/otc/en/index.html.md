# Overview

## Generating API Key

You will need to create an API key on the BTSE platform before you can use authenticated APIs. To create API keys, you can follow the steps below:

* Login with your username / email and password into the BTSE website
* Click on “Account” on the top right hand corner
* Select the API tab
* Click on “New API” button to create an API key and passphrase. (Note: the passphrase will only appear once)
* Use your API key and passphrase to construct a signature.

## Endpoints

* Production
  * HTTP
     * `https://api.btse.com/otc`
  * Websocket
     * `wss://ws.btse.com/ws/otc`
* Testnet
  * HTTP
     * `https://testapi.btse.io/otc`
  * Websocket
     * `wss://testws.btse.io/ws/otc`


## Authentication

* API Key (request-api)
  * Parameter Name: `request-api`, in: header. API key is obtained from BTSE platform as a string

* API Key (request-nonce)
  * Parameter Name: `request-nonce`, in: header. Representation of current timestamp in long format

* API Key (request-sign)
  * Parameter Name: `request-sign`, in: header. A composite signature produced based on the following algorithm: Signature=HMAC.Sha384 (secretkey, (urlpath + request-nonce + bodyStr)) (note: bodyStr = '' when no data):

### Example 1: Query Quote

> **HMAC SHA384 Signature**

```shell
$ echo -n "/api/v1/quote1624985375123{\"orderSizeInBaseCurrency\":1,\"orderAmountInOrderCurrency\":0,\"side\":\"buy\",\"baseCurrency\":\"BTC\",\"orderCurrency\":\"USD\"}" | openssl dgst -sha384 -hmac "848db84ac252b6726e5f6e7a711d9c96d9fd77d020151b45839a5b59c37203bx"
(stdin)= 8ee43810606da581fb6ce03e10370f89125c2269a64de832a55cea219795e9ae0c3df86b51afbafdd28c03b16acd1427
```

* Endpoint to place an order is `https://api.btse.com/otc/api/v1/quote`
* Assume we have the values as follows:
  * request-nonce: `1624985375123`
  * request-api: `4e9536c79f0fdd72bf04f2430982d3f61d9d76c996f0175bbba470d69d59816x`
  * secret: `848db84ac252b6726e5f6e7a711d9c96d9fd77d020151b45839a5b59c37203bx`
  * Path: `/api/v1/quote`
  * Body: `{"orderSizeInBaseCurrency":1,"orderAmountInOrderCurrency":0,"side":"buy","baseCurrency":"BTC","orderCurrency":"USD"}`
  * Encrypted Text: `"/api/v1/quote1624985375123{"orderSizeInBaseCurrency":1,"orderAmountInOrderCurrency":0,"side":"buy","baseCurrency":"BTC","orderCurrency":"USD"}"`
* Generated signature will be:
  * request-sign: `8ee43810606da581fb6ce03e10370f89125c2269a64de832a55cea219795e9ae0c3df86b51afbafdd28c03b16acd1427`


## Rate Limits

* The following rate limits are enforced:

Rate limits for BTSE is as follows:

* Per API: `15 requests/second`
* Per User: `30 requests/second`

## API Status Codes

Each API will return one of the following HTTP status:

* 200 - API request was successful, refer to the specific API response for expected payload
* 400 - Bad Request. Server will not process this request. This is usually due to invalid parameters sent in request
* 401 - Unauthorized request. Server will not process this request as it does not have valid authentication credentials
* 403 - Forbidden request. Credentials were provided but they were insufficient to perform the request
* 404 - Not found. Indicates that the server understood the request but could not find a correct representation for the target resource
* 405 - Method not allowed. Indicates that the request method is not known to the requested server
* 408 - Request timeout. Indicates that the server did not complete the request. BTSE API timeouts are set at 30secs
* 429 - Too many requests. Indicates that the client has exceeded the rates limits set by the server. Refer to Rate Limits for more details
* 500 - Internal server error. Indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition resulting in not being able to fulfill the request

## API ENUM

When connecting up the BTSE API, you will come across number codes that represents different states or status types in BTSE. The following section provides a list of codes that you are expecting to see.

* 30000: OTC_ORDER_QUERY
* 30001: OTC_ORDER_QUOTE
* 30007: OTC_ORDER_COMPLETE_SUCCESS
* 30008: OTC_ORDER_REQUOTE

# Workflow

* Request for Quote to get an OTC quote from BTSE
* BTSE responds with a quote based on the request
* If users chooses to accept the quote, quote is sent to BTSE (Quote Accepted)
* If quote is accepted by BTSE, then transaction is completed (Transaction Completed)
* If quote rejected by BTSE, then BTSE will respond with an updated quote with reason of the rejection
* If quote is rejected by the user, then BTSE will respond if quote is rejected successfully (Quote Rejected)
