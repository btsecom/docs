You will need to create an API key on the BTSE platform before you can use authenticated APIs. To create API keys, you can follow the steps below:

* Login with your username / email and password into the BTSE website
* Click on `Account` on the top right hand corner
* Select the API tab
* Click on `New API` button to create an API key and passphrase. (Note: the passphrase will only appear once)
* Use your API key and passphrase to construct a signature.

## Endpoints

* Production
  * HTTP
     * `https://api.btse.com/spot`
  * Websocket
     * `wss://ws.btse.com/ws/spot`
  * Websocket (for orderbook stream)
     * `wss://ws.btse.com/ws/oss/spot` (Used for Orderbook incremental update stream)
* Testnet
  * HTTP
     * `https://testapi.btse.io/spot`
  * Websocket
     * `wss://testws.btse.io/ws/spot`
  * Websocket (for orderbook stream)
     * `wss://testws.btse.io/ws/oss/spot` (Used for Orderbook incremental update stream)

## Authentication

* API Key (btse-api)
  * Parameter Name: `btse-api`, in: header. API key is obtained from BTSE platform as a string

* API Key (btse-nonce)
  * Parameter Name: `btse-nonce`, in: header. Representation of current timestamp in long format

* API Key (btse-sign)
  * Parameter Name: `btse-sign`, in: header. A composite signature produced based on the following algorithm: Signature=HMAC.Sha384 (secretkey, (urlpath + btse-nonce + bodyStr)) (note: bodyStr = '' when no data):

### Example 1: Place an order

> **HMAC SHA384 Signature**

```shell
$ echo -n "/api/v3.2/order1624985375123{\"postOnly\":false,\"price\":8500.0,\"side\":\"BUY\",\"size\":0.002,\"stopPrice\":0.0,\"symbol\":\"BTC-USD\",\"time_in_force\":\"GTC\",\"trailValue\":0.0,\"triggerPrice\":0.0,\"txType\":\"LIMIT\",\"type\":\"LIMIT\"}" | openssl dgst -sha384 -hmac "848db84ac252b6726e5f6e7a711d9c96d9fd77d020151b45839a5b59c37203bx"

```

* Endpoint to place an order is `https://api.btse.com/spot/api/v3.2/order`

* Generated signature will be:
  * btse-sign: `e9cd0babdf497b536d1e48bc9cf1fadad3426b36406b5747d77ae4e3cdc9ab556863f2d0cf78e0228c39a064ad43afb7`

## Dead Man's Switch (Cancel All After)

> Request

```json
{
  "timeout": 60000
}
```

`POST /api/v3.2/order/cancelAllAfter`

Dead-man's switch allows the trader to send in a timeout value which is a Time to live (TTL) value for an order. Extension of the timeout is done by sending another `cancelAllAfter` request. If the server does not receive another request before the timeout is reached, all orders will be cancelled.

| ---     | ---  | ---      | ---                           |
| timeout | long | Yes      | Timeout value in milliseconds |

Subscribe to Orderbook incremental updates through the endpoint `wss://ws.btse.com/ws/oss/spot`. The format of topic will be `update:symbol_grouping` (eg. `update:BTC-USD_0`). The first response received will be a snapshot of the current orderbook (this is indicated in the `type` field) and 50 levels will be returned. Incremental updates will be sent in subsequent packets with type `delta`.

Bids and asks will be sent in `price` and `size` tuples. The size sent will be the new updated size for the price. If a value of `0` is sent, the price should be removed from the local copy of the orderbook.

To ensure that the updates are received in sequence, `seqNum` indicates the current sequence and `prevSeqNum` refers to the packet before. `seqNum` will always be one after the `prevSeqNum`. If the sequence is out of order, you will need to unsubscribe and re-subscribe to the topic again.

Also if [crossed orderbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book#Crossed_book) ever occurs when the best bid higher or equal to the best ask, please unsubscribe and re-subscribe to the topic again.
